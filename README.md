# Iterative-Solvers

## Work in Progress:
- * [x] Gauss and Cholesky Decompostion on naive dense matrices.
- * [x] Conjugate Gradient and Diaogonal Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient on Sparse-Matrix ( https://github.com/uestla/Sparse-Matrix)
- * [x] Trial SPD matrices for benchmarking solvers. 
- * [ ] Sparse Matrix usage on direct solvers.
- * [ ] GMRES implementation.
- * [ ] Trying different sparse matrix implementations and profiling.

# Solvers are not complete yet.
